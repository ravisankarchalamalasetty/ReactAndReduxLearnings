React: by enforcing a clear structure (container and functional components) and a
strict data flow (components react   to state and props change) 
now its easier than before to create well reasoned UI logic

A more concise version of the component can be 
expressed by removing the constructor using class fields.

But now with React hooks
itâ€™s possible to express the flow internal state change -> UI reaction without
